Features:

**Key Features of My Dog-Parent Friendly Web Application:**

1. **Robust Front-End with React**:
   - I used React, a popular JavaScript library, to create a robust and interactive front-end. This allowed me to build a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing adoption posts for dogs.
   - Leveraging React's component-based architecture, I designed reusable UI components, making my code more modular and easier to maintain.

2. **React Router for Dynamic Client-Side Routing**:
   - I implemented React Router, a library that enables client-side routing in React applications. This enhanced the user experience by enabling features like dynamic navigation between different views or pages without the need for full page reloads.
   - Users can seamlessly move through the application, thanks to the dynamic routing provided by React Router.

3. **MongoDB Database with Mongoose Schema**:
   - To store user accounts and detailed dog profiles securely, I designed a MongoDB database schema using Mongoose, a Node.js library tailored for working with MongoDB.
   - With Mongoose, I defined the data structure, allowing for efficient interactions with the database, including the ability to create, read, update, and delete records.

4. **Data Security with bcrypt Password Hashing**:
   - Ensuring data security is paramount. To achieve this, I implemented bcrypt password hashing. Bcrypt is a widely-recognized library for securely hashing and salting passwords.
   - By hashing passwords with bcrypt, I safeguarded user account data, providing robust protection against potential data breaches.

5. **RESTful API Endpoints for CRUD Operations**:
   - To facilitate user interactions with the back-end server, I developed RESTful API endpoints. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for designing networked applications.
   - These endpoints empower users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on adoption posts and dog profiles. For instance, users can effortlessly create new adoption posts, access dog details, make updates, or remove posts when necessary.

In summary, my web application is designed to be user-centric, providing a smooth and secure experience for managing dog adoption posts and profiles. The combination of React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB forms a powerful stack that ensures a strong front-end and a scalable back-end, ultimately enhancing the user experience.
